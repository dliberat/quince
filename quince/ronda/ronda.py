"""
A ronda is the shortest possible complete segment of a game,
from initial deal to points calculation.

A ronda is played in the following manner:

Players play in clockwise order, starting from the left of the dealer
(the dealer always plays last). During their turn each player can either:

a) Use one of the cards they have in their hand to pick up cards from the mesa
b) Lay down one of their cards on the mesa

The ronda starts by dealing 4 cards to the mesa, and 3 cards to each player.

Note: If the 4 cards that got dealt to the mesa add up to 15, they
are awarded to the dealer immediately along with an escoba, and not replaced.
The ronda begins with an empty table

Then, each player takes their turn, repeating 3 times around until the
players have used all of the cards in their hand.

At this point, the dealer once again deals 3 cards to each player, and
play continues in the same manner.

The ronda ends when all the cards in the deck have been dealt out.

Once all players have played all their cards, any cards that remain
on the mesa will be awarded to the player who last picked up cards.

A complete game will have as many rondas as necessary
until one player reaches a total of 30 points.
